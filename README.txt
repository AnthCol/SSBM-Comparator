Special Thanks to:
https://www.ssbwiki.com/Category:Head_icons_(SSBM) for the character head sprites.

https://meleeframedata.com and its creator Mitchell Meier (as well as all of the people that helped him make that website) for the data
used to create this project. 

Limitations:
    Values only include the strong hits of moves. 
    Comparing weak hits is not an option as of right now, perhaps I will add some capability for that in the future, but we'll see.
